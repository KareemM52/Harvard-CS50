In my final project, I decided to make a code for a functional vending machine in python language. 
This can help out my community a lot because vending machines are very common where I am from. 
As a result, it makes my code very helpful for such thing. 
My vending machine consists of 10 items that have different price values. 
If there's insufficient amount of money entered into the vending machine, it returns a message to the buyer and when there's enough money, it gives the desired item, change (if any) and returns a different message along.
